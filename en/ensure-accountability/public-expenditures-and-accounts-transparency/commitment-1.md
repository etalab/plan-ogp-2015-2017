# Commitment 1

## Enable citizens to consult, have a better understanding and reuse financial data and decisions of local and regional authorities

### Open Regional and Local Authorities’ data

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of the Interior
- Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service

#### Stakes

To meet the citizens’ legitimate expectations and considering the large proportion of public funds spent by local and regional authorities, the financial transparency of these local authorities must be improved.

#### Context & Aim

Numerous local and regional authorities have begun using digital tools to account for their financial management and to increase budgetary transparency. The Government wishes to support and encourage this movement, which will be enhanced by the bill on the **new territorial organization of the Republic (NOTRe)**. It will provide the legislative framework necessary to pursue this openness and data circulation policy, particularly regarding financial data.  

Currently, all documents attached to the budgets and accounts of city governments, including documents substantiating the accounts, may be communicated to anyone requesting them, in application of article L. 2121-26 of the local and regional authorities' general code. The publication of budgets and financial statements in open data has already been implemented by various local authorities such as the [city of Rennes](http://www.data.rennes-metropole.fr/), the [city of Montpellier](http://montpellier.territoirenumerique.org/), the [city of Paris]((http://opendata.paris.fr/)), the [province of Hauts-de-Seine](http://opendata.hauts-de-seine.net/), the [Provence Alpes Côtes d'Azur region](http://opendata.regionpaca.fr/)…

Furthermore, the Public Finances Directorate-General already publishes local authority financial files summarizing the main financial and tax issues, making information easy to access. They can be found on the joint site DGCL-DGFiP: [collectivites-locales.gouv.fr](http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/). Further progress is planned in this area. It is planned to soon publish this information in open data.

Lastly, since 2014 the financial jurisdictions[^1] initiated the opening of the first sets of public data, and now wish to go further with this approach, particularly by publishing more financial data.

#### Roadmap

- **Allow citizens to better grasp the financial details of local and regional authorities**
    - Publish in open data the general operating grant (Dotation globale de fonctionnement) which is the State's financial contribution to local and regional authorities
    - Publish in open data, on data.gouv.fr, all of account balances of local authorities and groups with specific taxation, from 2013 financial year onward
    - Make it compulsory for local executives and chairmen of EPCI  to present a report to deliberative assembly (municipal, departmental or regional council) on the follow-up given to observations made by the regional chamber of the Cour des comptes
- **Regularly provide the financial data of the financial jurisdictions such as**:
    - The data used for the work on local finance
    - Some data on financial jurisdictions activities, notably the updated list of publications from the Cour des comptes and the resources of the financial jurisdictions
- **Strengthen open data in local and regional authorities: enshrine in law the requirement for local communities of more than 3500 inhabitants to publish their public information in open data format**

#### See Also:

- The **national platform data.gouv.fr was designed to host and easily reference local authorities open data**. These can either host their data on [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/) by creating their own page, or have their platform and data automatically referenced through APIs and web harvesting.
- Etalab has **also specifically made the platform territoire.data.gouv.fr available to local and regional authorities**. Registering for free, they can create a page dedicated to data issued from centralized and decentralized administrations relative to their community – population, housing, public accounts, employment, highways, social action, culture, environment, facilities, etc. These data sets can be automatically exported on the local authority's Internet site.
- The association Open Data France has established a list of “priority” data that may be made available by local authorities, and will provide support to those who wish to open these data: http://www.opendatafrance.net/2015/06/19/loi-notre-quelles-sont-les-donnees-publiques-a-ouvrir-en-priorite/

### Publish the decisions and reports of municipal council meetings online

**Lead institution**:
- Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service

#### Stakes

The monitoring of decisions made by local authorities is essential for information and participation in public life.

#### Context & Aim

Regulatory acts cannot be executed prior to their publication in full in the list of administrative measures or in any other municipal document, or before they are posted. This hardcopy publication can be accompanied by an additional publication in digital format. Said digital publication does not replace the hard copy version of the publication. Any individual or legal entity can also receive municipal by-laws under the conditions stipulated in Act 78-753 of 17 July 1978 and publish them under its responsibility.

To render information and local decisions more accessible, online publication will be reinforced as part of the bill on the **new territorial organization of the Republic (NOTRe)**.

#### Roadmap

- **Publish the list of administrative measures, deliberations, and local municipal by-laws in electronic format alongside a paper version, and provide permanent access free of charge.**
- **Post the minutes for municipal council meetings within one week after the municipal council meeting on the local government website (where it exists) for at least six years** (as opposed to a one-off posting made within eight days for an indeterminate minimum period).

### Publish information relative to building permits in open data

**Lead institution**:
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy

#### Context & Aim

In accordance with Article L.2121-26 of the General Local Authorities Code, decisions relating to building permits can be provided to any person requesting said information. Said decisions must also be published in hardcopy format.

Certain aggregated data have already been provided by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy and by some local authorities. Given that building permits contain personal data, significant efforts will be required to anonymize personal data in order to provide granular data.

#### Roadmap

- **Start a working group with the stakeholders concerned to gradually arrange open data access to building permits data by 2017**
    - This collaboration could bring together Chief Data Officer, Etalab, the General Commissariat for Sustainable Development, and local authorities (via Open Data France, for example)
