# Commitment 3

## Improve transparency in international development aid

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development
- Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts
- Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital sector
- French Development Agency (AFD)

### Stakes

**Transparency in public development aid contributes to better management of public funds and efficiency of projects**. Publication of data, feedback from the field and stakeholder control help to strengthen beneficiaries ownership and to fight corruption. The instructive approach of the web site [www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr](http://www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr/) enables citizens to seek information on the destination and use of funds dedicated to development aid.

Transparency in public development aid illustrates a process of dialogue and accountability between administrations, public operators, NGOs and citizens. Opening data can facilitate this process, and thus improve targeting of this policy.

### Context & Aim

Since 2014, the policy on the transparency of public development aid has been given a new impetus. The July 7th 2014 Bill on orientation and programming related to international development and solidarity policy sets an objective of data transparency concerning the **16 priority developing countries**[^1].

Data on projects funded over 100,000€ and implemented in the 16 priority developing countries has gradually been published on [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/) in the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) format. This was the result of a joint effort by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development and the French Development Agency, in connection with the Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts. Data on food aid, humanitarian aid, external action of local and regional authorities, co-development and priority solidarity fund projects is also published on [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/).

For the first time and simultaneously, France has also made this data accessible on [www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr](http://www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr/). Beyond displaying data on public development aid, this web site allows anyone to request information on funded projects. Initially focused on Mali, this web site is gradually being extended to the 16 priority developing countries covered by the French cooperation and development policy.

### Roadmap

The French Development Agency will gradually open data on funding granted to sectors under their responsibility in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean countries, Asia and Latin America. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development will then add data on projects funded in these zones to expand the site [www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr](http://www.transparence-aide.gouv.fr/). All this data will be published regularly in the IATI format and hosted or referenced on www.data.gouv.fr. The transparency threshold of €100,000 will be removed by these two stakeholders for projects run by NGOs. Transparency will be applicable whatever the amount from 2016. The Finance and Economy Ministry will continue to reference, on the site [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/), the definitive declaration of data from France to the OECD, within the shortest deadlines compatible with maintaining the verification and control function for OECD statistical data.

- **Continue the provision of data on public development aid by extending the scope of zones and the types of projects covered**
    - _2015_:
        - Opening, in June, of the French Development Agency (AFD) data on funding granted within their sector of responsibility in the sub-Saharan African and Mediterranean countries.
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/125)]_
        - Gradual opening in the second half-year by the MAEDI (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development) data for the African zone (countries to be determined)
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/126)]_
        - Publication of data relating to priority solidarity fund projects, humanitarian aid, food aid, co-development projects and actions of the DAECT (Delegation for External Action of Local and Regional Authorities) on the portal "data.gouv.fr"
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/128)]_
    - _2016_:
        - Gradual opening of the MAEDI data on Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (countries to be determined)
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/129)]_
        - Opening at the end of June, by the AFD data on Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (sovereign sector for the AFD)
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/130)]_
        - Publication of the AFD and MAEDI open data, in the IATI format, on projects run by NGOs (whatever their amount) in the countries already subject to the publication of this data
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/131)]_
    - _2017_:
        - Reduction, by the AFD and the MAEDI, of the publication threshold from €100,000 to €50,000 for all projects in the countries already concerned (except NGO projects, published whatever their amount)
        _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/132)]_
        
All of these releases should be in open data, published regularly, in the IATI format and for projects of €100,000 or more.
