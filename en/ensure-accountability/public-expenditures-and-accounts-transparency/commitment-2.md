# Commitment 2

## Increase transparency in public procurement

**Lead institutions**:
- Prime Minister’s Office
- Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts
- Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector

### Stakes

According to data collected by the public procurement economic monitoring center, the amount spent on public contracts was **€71.5 billion in 20131**[^1].

The transparency and proper management of public procurement are essential issues for France. They are mentioned in the January 29th, 1993 Bill on the prevention of corruption and transparency in economic life and public procedures ("Loi Sapin") and in the Public Procurement Code(CMP)[^2]. From its first article, this code makes transparency one of the three fundamental principles governing public procurement.

- The **advertising of public calls for tenders** is covered by provisions of articles 26 and 40 of the CMP which includes the obligation of publishing public call for tenders for amounts over €90,0003, either in the Official Bulletin of Public Contract Declarations (BOAMP) or in a journal authorized to receive legal declarations, as well as on its buyer profile.
- **Disclosure on awarded public tenders** is covered by the provisions of articles 85, 131 and 133 of the CMP.

### Context & Aim

A [public procurement economic monitoring center](http://www.economie.gouv.fr/daj/lobservatoire-economique-lachat-public), under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance, was created in order to collect and analyze data on economic and technical aspects of public procurement and to constitute a permanent body for consultation and exchange of information with economic operators.

Some data on awarded tenders is already available in open data on [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/) (notably data published by the State Procurement Service[^3] or by certain local and regional authorities), but this only gives a very partial view of whole public procurement.

**This transparency must be further improved**: in fact, it is as much an issue of accountability, demonstrating the proper management of public funds, as an economic issue, facilitating the fair access of companies to public procurement, and an issue of the public action efficiency, allowing better control of this policy by public managers.

The transposition of three European directives between now and April 2016[^4] (two directives on public procurement and one directive on concession contracts) will improve this transparency. The directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement specifies the mandatory dematerialization of procedures above European thresholds. Electronic dispatch of notices to be published and online access to calls for tenders documents are already in effect since 2006. In January 2015, the economic and financial ministries have undertaken a public consultation on the draft ruling transposing the legislative chapter of the "public contracts" directives[^5].

Lastly, more resources can be made available through public procurement by publishing open data collected during the execution of contracts awarded by public administrations, taking into account specific conditions applying to the fields of defense and national security.

### Verbatim from the ["open data" online consultation](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/open-gov-comment-faire-progresser-la-transparence-de-l%E2%80%99action-publique-et-la-participation)

"_In many cases, contracts awarded by local authorities and administrations enable the collection and processing of data, which may then usefully made available within open data policies. To facilitate this opening, the law should specify the default inclusion of an open data clause in all public contracts or agreements, including those in public service delegation contracts._"

### Roadmap

- **Standardize the format of data of public call for tenders**
_[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/120)]_
- **Release in open data the Official Bulletin of Public Contract Declarations (BOAMP) or those from other publication entities, and publish buyers profiles**
_[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/121)]_
- **Encourage increased publicity of awarded public tenders**
    - Make this publication mandatory for tenders above regulation thresholds. Encourage and support buyers to do it also for tenders below regulation threshold and to make buyers profiles accessible.
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/122)]_ 
    - Promote open data, particularly by standardizing advertising forms and presenting them in machine readable formats. Data to be opened in priority will be selected after a study phase that will not exceed one year
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/123)]_ 
- **Include open data clauses in contracts awarded by public authorities**
    - Encourage service providers to open data produced during the execution of a contract by defining standard open data clauses specifying the requirements and that public authorities could include in contracts.
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/124)]_ 

### See Also:

- Public contracts of the **City of Paris** now contain an open data clause[^6]: since 17 April 2014, each call for tenders includes provisions obliging the future contractor to release data produced while executing the contract.
- Local initiatives such as [My Breizh Open Data](http://breizhsmallbusinessact.fr/my-breizh-open-data-marches-publics/), supported by the Brittany region, have developed an open data platform for public procurement, to improve the visibility and legibility of local public procurement.
