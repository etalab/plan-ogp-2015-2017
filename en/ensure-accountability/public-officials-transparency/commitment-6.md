# Commitment 6

## Facilitate access to data regarding transparency obligations of public officials

**Lead institution**:
- High Authority for Transparency in Public Life

### Context & Aim

**Since the October 11th 2013 Transparency Bills, public life has beneficiated from a new impulsion**. In particular, these bills state that the 10,000 highest-ranking public officials (elected or appointed) must declare their assets and interests to the **High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (HATVP)**, the body monitoring said assets and interests. One of the bills’ objectives is to widely involve civil society in these controls.

Declarations of assets and interests of members of the Government, as well as declarations of interests by French and European members of Parliament and local elected representatives, are published and posted on the HATVP website. According to the Constitutional Council, the publication of this information allows "each citizen to ensure the implementation of guarantees on the probity and integrity of these elected representatives, and to avoid and prevent conflicts of interest"[^1]. It also allows citizens to complement these declarations by passing on to the High Authority information they have and that is not contained in the declarations published.

Declarations can be sent to the HATVP in paper format or, since the decree of March 3rd  2015, via an online reporting tool. This new online reporting tool makes published declarations more accessible, notably preventing potential problems of interpretation associated with handwritten declarations. This momentum must be maintained by supporting the circulation of information published in an open, easy-to-use format.

### Roadmap

- **Publish public data contained in declarations of assets and interests made using an online reporting tool in an open, reusable format** (declarations of assets made by members of the Government and declarations of interests of members of the Government, members of Parliament, French representatives in the European Parliament and main local elected officials)
    - With the development of the online reporting tool (ADEL), it will be possible to circulate information in a reusable format within the 2016 year

    - Efforts by HATVP to convey the information about the online reporting tool to persons bound by reporting obligations will be stepped up. The aim is to ensure a high level of remote reporting and, as a result, a large volume of open-data information
