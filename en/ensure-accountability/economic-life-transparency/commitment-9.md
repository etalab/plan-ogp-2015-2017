## Increase transparency in international trade commercial negotiations

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital sector
- Ministry of State for Foreign Trade, the Promotion of Tourism and French Nationals Abroad, attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development

### Stakes

France is engaged in numerous cycles of multilateral trade negotiations which have a strong economic impact. **Establishing a dialogue with civil society and establishing transparency about French positions help companies, associations and citizens better understand the issues associated with these policies**: public services, preservation of collective preferences (health, social and environmental standards), cultural diversity, non-tariff barriers, access to public contracts, mechanisms for settling disputes, etc.

### Context & Aim

Ministry of State for Foreign Trade, the Promotion of Tourism and French Nationals Abroad, attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development is committed to implementing an agenda for transparency in international trade negotiations.

A **committee for the strategic monitoring of trade policy subjects**, composed of two panels, one grouping civil society, non-governmental organizations, unions and professional federations, the second grouping members of Parliament (National Assembly, Senate and European Parliament), has been established in order to best respond to the democratic requirement for transparency in trade negotiations. In March 2015, this strategic monitoring committee was strengthened by the creation of a series of working groups covering a variety of trade policy subjects and open to all members of the committee.

On December 2nd 2014, at the initiative of the Ministry of State for Foreign Trade, the Promotion of Tourism and French Nationals Abroad, a series of documents (negotiating mandates, treaties, minutes of the strategic monitoring committee) relating to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) were published on a [dedicated page on diplomatie.gouv.fr](http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/politique-etrangere-de-la-france/diplomatie-economique-et-commerce/accords-de-libre-echange/) and [as open data on data.gouv.fr](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/premiers-pas-vers-la-transparence-des-negociations-commerciales-internationales-publication-sur-data-gouv-fr-de-documents-relatifs-au-ttip-et-au-ceta). They follow on from the declassification, by the European Commission, at French instigation, of its mandate for negotiation for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This page is regularly updated and provides direct access to the position documents of the European Commission.

All of the minutes of the committee for the strategic monitoring of trade policy subjects will be made available to the public, together with the annual reports to Parliament on trade negotiations. Additional elements, such as mandates, may be added according to the declassification decisions taken by the European Union. The stock of elements concerning past international trade negotiations will be added to this corpus: these are mainly negotiating mandates from the European Commission made public, official position documents made available to the public and the text of trade treaties ratified and made public. Studies and elements for the analysis and evaluation of trade agreements _ex post_ and _ex ante_, whether they are transverse or sectorial, will also be added to the corpus.
