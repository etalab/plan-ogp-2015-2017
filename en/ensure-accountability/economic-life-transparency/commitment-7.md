# Commitment 7

## Identify the beneficial owners of legal entities registered in France

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Justice
- Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts
- Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector

### Stakes

**Knowing clients and beneficiaries of financial activities is one of the pillars of the fight against money laundering, corruption and tax evasion**. It enables to **detect atypical operations that may be related to criminal transactions**.

The beneficial owners of legal entities, as defined in Article L561-2-2 of the French monetary and financial code are "_the individuals who, directly or indirectly, control the client, or the individual for whom a transaction is executed or an activity is carried out_". Transparency on beneficial owners can improve the overall transparency of shell companies and trusts and fight against money laundering, corruption and tax evasion.

### Context & Aim

On February 5th 2013, the European Commission presented a draft directive on preventing the use of the financial system for money laundering and terror financing, known as the “**4th anti-money laundering directive**[^1]”. It was officially published on June 5th 2015.

In the context of negotiating this directive, an agreement was reached on December 16th 2014 on the question of beneficial owners. It specifies the creation of a central register per Member State, with a gradual access (i.e. with no restrictions for competent authorities and financial surveillance bodies, in the context of their competencies relating to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing for the obliged entities, and with the condition of a legitimate interest for third-parties such as NGOs and journalists).

According to the agreement of December 16th 2014, the text opens the possibility for a Member State, in its national regulation, to make the access to this central register fully open (recital #15 of the Directive, article 30 §3 which quotes a “public register” as an example).

Published on June 5th 2015, this Directive will have to be transposed within two years from its publication, with a choice of procedures for accessing the register for Member States.

In order to improve this transparency, it is proposed to make the identification of beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities registered in France mandatory, to centralize this information in a register and to make this information widely open.

### Roadmap

- **Use a centralized registry, composed of various data, including data from the French central public registry for companies called Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés (RCS), in order to keep and provide a widely open access to adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities, consistently with the new 4th Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing provisions**
