# Commitment 8

## Strengthen transparency in payments and income from extractive industries

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts
- Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector

### Stakes

**Transparency in the extractive industries aims to promote greater corporate social responsibility and better public governance**, as well as to increase the trust of investors and the public in the mining sector.

It also fulfills the duty for exemplary behavior that France wishes to demonstrate towards developing and emerging countries, by strengthening standards that contribute to putting international companies on an equal footing. It supports political will to develop a responsible mining activity in French Guiana and to promote the mining sector in metropolitan France.

### Context & Aim

Since 2002, the **Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)** has brought together, on a voluntary basis, States, extractive companies and civil society organizations wishing to promote, in countries that are rich in natural resources, greater transparency in the income from mineral exploitation. France has provided political, technical and financial support to this initiative since 2005. The main mining, oil and gas companies, such as AREVA, TOTAL, ERAMET and ENGIE officially support ITIE. Also, the international coalition "Publish What You Pay", a civil-society movement at the origin of the ITIE, has a French platform currently coordinated by Oxfam France. At the G8 summit in Lough Erne in June 2013, the President of the French Republic stated that France intended to apply the ITIE standard throughout its territory and become a "candidate country" for the initiative.

At the same time, France argued for the adoption, at the European level, of a **restrictive standard for transparency** (Chapter 10 of directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and Council meeting dated June 26th 2013[^1], transposed in the Act No. 2014-1662 dated December 30th 2014 covering various provisions on the adaptation of legislation to European Union law in economic and financial matters[^2]), which would oblige French companies to declare, per project and per country, the payments they make as part of their extractive activities from the 2015 tax year. This legislative provision was included in the French commercial code on December 30th 2014.
