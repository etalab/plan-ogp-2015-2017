# Commitment 4

## Open access to evaluations of public policies and to their conclusions

**Lead institution**:
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

Evaluation of public policies helps decision-makers make public action more relevant, effective and efficient and contributes to informing citizens. The stake of evaluation goes beyond those of its direct protagonists and concerns all citizens. Nevertheless, access to these various works remains complex due to the large number of players involved and the multitude of distribution media used.

### Context & Aim

The Prime Minister's circular dated on February 23th, 1989, (10 May 1988/15 May 1991), on the renewal of public service, was an important step in the **affirmation of public policy evaluations as a tool for government modernization**.

Evaluating a public policy means judging its value with regard to a set of criteria, in order to improve and inform decision-making. According to the decree of [18 November 1998](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005626964&dateTexte=20110516), it means "assessing, within an interministerial framework, the effectiveness of this policy by comparing its results to objectives assigned and resources used".

Today, public policy landscape is marked by numerous stakeholders: Parliament, Ministries, the Cour des comptes, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (CESE), the Regional Economic, Social and Environmental Councils, local and regional authorities, State agencies, etc. The diversity of actors involved in evaluations and of media used for publication now raises questions about the legibility and impact of these evaluations in public decision-making. Furthermore, citizens aspire to get more involved in the evaluation and design of public policies.

The **government will undertake a process involving all these actors** so that, gradually, **citizens will have more visibility on the work carried out, reports will increasingly be made public and contribution of evaluations in public decision-making will be more legible**.

To do this, the government primarily relies on the best practices of its own approach. 59 evaluations have been launched since the end of 2012, covering numerous public policy fields (social affairs, national education, justice, ecology, housing, etc.). In June 2015, 43 reports were published on the web site of the Secretary-General for Government Modernization (SGMAP)[^1] (some evaluations are still ongoing). In the dedicated area, a gauge indicates the progress of each evaluation (by large milestones: launch, diagnostics, transformation scenarios, report, implementation), along with the related documentation. The methodology promoted by the SGMAP recommends to systematically involve users benefiting from the evaluated policy (through consultations, polls, ad hoc surveys and workshops), and for stakeholders to be invited to monitor the evaluation work as part of an "evaluation committee".

The SGMAP also provided its support and contributed to funding the project run by the French Evaluation Society (SFE), which has been developing, since 2012, a Public Policies Evaluation Observatory. The SFE gathers 300 members (230 individual members and 70 institutional members: State services, local and regional authorities, public institutions, associations and consulting firms). This observatory has already listed more than 1600 references for evaluations made since 2000, and published summaries of corresponding reports for half of them.

This initiative is a first step towards the creation of a resource center that will offer an easy access to all evaluation work, in order to help members of Parliament in their mission of drafting bills and controlling the government, as well as decision-makers, public administrators and citizens.

### Roadmap

- **Encourage all actors involved in evaluations to make their work available in the Public Policies Evaluation Observatory, to improve its comprehensiveness and facilitate research through its database (access by keyword, etc.)**
    - Make the Public Policies Evaluation Observatory available to all, as the reference database for public policies evaluations
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/135)]_
    - Systematize the publication of public policies evaluations launched in the context of government modernization programs (when not prevented by legal considerations)
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/137)]_
- **Systematize and improve citizens' participation in evaluations coordinated by the SGMAP, for example through opinion surveys, workshops for citizens' juries, etc.**
     _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/138)]_
- **Improve the traceability of impact on public action of public policies evaluations launched under government modernization programs**
