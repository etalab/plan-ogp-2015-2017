# Commitment 5

## Impliquer davantage les citoyens dans les travaux menés par la Cour des comptes

**Lead institution**:
- Cour des comptes

### Stakes

The Constitution states that the Cour des comptes is responsible for making a free, independent and collegial assessment of the use of public funds. It is a key institution of the French Republic. It is an independent jurisdiction situated midway between the Parliament and the Government, which provides assistance to both. It plays an essential role in the functioning of our democracy and government modernization.

The Cour des comptes further undertaking on opening its own data, on promoting analysis based on data sciences, on developing citizens’ involvement in its work, contributes to the institution's commitment to the French process of open government.  

### Context & Aim

Every year, the Cour des comptes, the regional and local chambers of the Cour des comptes and the organizations that are attached to it (High Council on Public Finances, Court of Budgetary and Financial Discipline, Council of Compulsory Levies, etc.) publish judicial decisions, reports and notices on the Cour des comptes’s website.

Articles 14 and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which provide the legal bedrock for the missions of the Cour des comptes, have remained very modern: in a democracy, citizens have the right to ascertain, by themselves or through their representatives, the need for public taxation, to consent to it freely, to watch over its use, and to determine its proportion, basis, collection and duration. They have the right to ask a public official for an accounting of her administration.

**These provisions are the first manifestos in favor of the opening of public information and more open and more transparent governance.**

Following these principles, the financial jurisdictions took the initiative, from 2014, of opening first sets of public data. They will take this process further in the months to come. They will involve citizens more in their work, subject to the precautions inherent to the functioning of an independent jurisdiction, notably respect for secrets protected by the law.

### Roadmap

- **Open some of the data collected during inspections and evaluations, as well as data specific to financial jurisdictions**

  The Cour des comptes undertakes to regularly provide the following data sets:

  - The budgetary data forming the basis of current or past analyses of State’s budget execution
  - When possible, the data forming the basis of current or past themed investigations of the Cour
  - The data forming the basis of current or past work on local finances
  - Certain data on activity of the financial jurisdictions, notably the update to the list of publications from the Court and the resources of the financial jurisdictions

  The Cour des comptes will also study, together with the Prime Minister’s Office, the establishment of a data portal "data.ccomptes.fr", listed on the government portal (data.gouv.fr), in order to systematize a strategy of data management and the opening of public information.

- **Further involve citizens in the work of the Cour des comptes**

  This involvement could take several forms:

  - Opinion surveys in order to better identify the expectations of citizens in relation to the work of the Cour des comptes, both in form and content
  - A contributory platform could be introduced to enable feedbacks from citizens' on their concerns
