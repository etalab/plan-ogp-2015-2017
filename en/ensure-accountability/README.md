# Ensure Accountability

France has for long built its democracy around the principles of accountability and transparency, already stated in 1789 in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen[^1].

Guaranteeing transparency and citizens' access to information requires a strong ethical and legal platform, independent authorities and a culture of prevention of conflicts of interest. Historically, France has given itself strong institutions for these purposes, in the name of fundamental principles such as the independence of justice and the freedom of the press.

The sharing and opening of information and the open data policies outline a significant evolution of our democratic practices, implying a greater involvement of civil society. Opening public data is a strong lever to strengthen the relationship between citizens and public officials. As pointed out by the Council of State, it "*provides all citizens and all groups with a right to see the methods and results of public policies, enabling them to denounce dysfunctions and even to help resolve them*"[^2].

France, its government and its regional and local authorities, have fully embraced this policy and many State-produced data are already available for all on the [data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/) platform (see chapter [Open Digital Resources](../open-resources/README.md)).

Nonetheless, progress in this area remains possible and desirable, while ensuring the safeguard of the Nation’s fundamental interests and the protection of some information, which should be reconciled with the objectives of transparency and openness of the Government.

A greater traceability of public policy evaluation, decision and management of public funds responds to key democratic stakes. It also provides guarantees for public efficiency.

Some information, such as those related to international development assistance, will benefit from being published in global open standards, thus facilitating international perspectives and analysis.

Finally, echoing the improvements that have been undertaken regarding corporations' social and environmental responsibilities or through the banking reform, other progress will be made in the realm of economic life itself: transparency of extractive industries' activities; transparency on the beneficial ownership of legal entities registered in France, in order to effectively fight money laundering, fiscal fraud and corruption; and transparency on the conduct of international trade negotiations and their stake.
