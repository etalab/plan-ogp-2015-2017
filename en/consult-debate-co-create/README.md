# Consult, Debate, Co-create

Organizing an open dialogue with civil society, mobilizing collective intelligence and empowering citizens to participate in public decision correspond both to citizens' expectations in our democracy and to a formidable lever for government modernization.

In this context, it is time to work with all forces, intermediary bodies and the country's dynamic forces, to fully renovate participation and decision making processes.

France has key institutions fully dedicated to the dialogue with civil society, such as the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (CESE), a consultative assembly established in 1927 and the National Commission for Public Debate created to guarantee a strong public debate around development projects of national interest.

Participation and open debate gradually imposed themselves as key public action principles, in particular in the environment, urban and regional planning and, more broadly, in the management of public resources.Â 

Many participative and civil society-focused listening mechanisms and tools have been implemented across the different administrations and Ministries. More than 150 texts a year are being posted for consultation on government websites.

In this domain even more than others, the new environment created by a large diffusion of Internet, digital tools and a culture of dialogue and co-creation have given way to new expectations.

Digital tools allow for new possibilities to gather numerous and diverse opinions, to give visibility to all perspectives, to make the memories of debates and their evolutions more readable and accessible to all and mostly to trigger useful and efficient collective action mechanisms.

Thanks to the digital resources shared by the public authorities (see chapter [Open Digital Resources](../open-resources/README.md)), open government allows for unprecedented opportunities for cooperation. For each citizen a new opportunity to influence and shape public policies emerges, with stakes such as:

- Include citizens in the identification of problems to be resolved,
- Build together with civil society the essential data infrastructure to society and economy,
- Facilitate the law making process thanks to innovative tools and applications.
