# Commitment 12

## Further expand the opening of legal resources & the collaboration with civil society on opening the law

**Lead institutions**:
- Prime Minister’s Office; Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

**Understanding of law and access to justice are the pillars of the Rule of Law**. In a digital era, this ambition is not restricted to diffusing content of the law but requires also accessibility to jurisprudence, the possibility for all citizens to develop innovative tools or services based on this content (thanks to its availability in open data), and the ability to stimulate and successfully mobilize citizens' expertise and contributions.

### Context & Aim

France already has created in 2001 a **major public service for the dissemination of law** over the Internet. According to the terms of [decree No. 2002-1064 dated on August 7th, 2002 amended](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000413818), on the public service for the dissemination of law over the Internet, the site [Légifrance](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/) is intended to facilitate public access to texts in force as well as to jurisprudence. It already provides free, universal access to all sources of law (legislative and regulatory texts, treaties, codes, jurisprudence of the Constitutional Council, the Council of State and the French Supreme Court, etc.).

The open-data provision of legal data and data relating to a legal bill or its preparation allows citizens to better understand the entire legislative process, develop tools or applications from this data and participate actively in the democratic debate.

The opening of legal data is thus at the core of governmental action, with the open-data publication of the databases of the Legal and Administrative Information Department (DILA) of the Prime Minister’s Office, and the establishment of the "[Open Law](http://www.dila.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/activites/experimentations/programme-open-law-le-droit-ouvert)" program. This program has given rise to numerous innovative applications developed by start-ups, researchers and companies, which were then rewarded. The publication in open data of the Official Bulletin of Public Contract Declarations (BOAMP), the Civil and Commercial Announcements Official Bulletin (BODACC) and the Mandatory Legal Notices Official Bulletin (BALO) will complement this approach[^1].

Lastly, the **consultation of citizens on government bills or before their preparation** enables the construction of effective public decisions may revitalizes democracy. When preparing the Digital Bill, the French Digital Council coordinated an [online consultation](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/) over six months (see details and data in the ["methodology" appendix](../../methodology.md)). It demonstrated the extent and ability of administrations and civil society to commit to these processes.

#### Verbatim from the ["open data" online consultation](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/open-gov-comment-faire-progresser-la-transparence-de-l%E2%80%99action-publique-et-la-participation)

> "Carrying out a study on an opening of digital management tools for the meeting could make available the text of the articles voted at all stages of the procedure. Standardization of publication with the services of the Senate and with the SGG and Légifrance, for example by considering opening projects of the SOLON type, would open very interesting prospects."

_"Regards Citoyens", [online contribution #2848](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/95/avis/2848)_

> "Numerous systems for document version management are precisely intended to monitor changes to text documents, such as Acts. The most widely known and used is the "Git" system. The use of such a system for registration of Acts, and its dissemination, would allow the subsequent tracking of the origin of each subparagraph (its author). Each amendment could thus be represented as a "commit" (a change), proposed by Member of Parliament. The results of votes may be added, as metadata, to each amendment. Citizens could also participate by submitting "pull requests" (changes to be validated) which could be examined by the Parliament. This repository should present a standard technical interface (Git), and a website allowing non-technician citizens to participate (such as https://github.com/ or https://www.penflip.com/)."

### Roadmap

- **Continue the open-data provision of legal and legislative resources that already exist**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/152)]_
- **Continue the collaborative process with civil society for the production of innovative services and open source tools facilitating the understanding of texts and their preparation**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/153)]_
- **On the Digital Bill, continue the participative process in collaboration with civil society by opening the draft bill (“avant projet de loi”) to consultation** for citizens to comment it and suggest amendments
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/154)]_

#### See Also:

The opening of this data and these tools allows innovative initiatives from citizens. For instance, "[The Legal Bill Factory](http://www.lafabriquedelaloi.fr/)" enables the monitoring of the entire Parliamentary procedure for the texts of Acts. It also contributed to the development of open software, such as "[the French civil code under git](https://github.com/steeve/france.code-civil)" or [Archéo Lex](https://archeo-lex.fr/), which provide consolidated versions of each legislative text (Act, code, constitution, etc.,) in a single file, tracking the complete history of modifications to the legislation.
