# Commitment 11

## Co-produce with civil society the data infrastructure essential to society and economy

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister
- Ministry of State for the Digital Sector, attached to the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector

### Stakes

The **new forms of collaboration between administrations and civil society** enable to create new common goods, necessary to public service, society and economy, in faster, more efficient and more cost effective ways than in the past.

### Context & Aim

With the diffusion of digital power in society, citizens are becoming more and more committed to producing resources that, until now, only public authority could produce. This situation could be a key opportunity for public authority to learn working with civil society. It is not only a source of democratic progress and a resource for improving the quality of public service, but also a means of retaining, in the public area, common assets which could eventually be threatened by the emergence of new de facto digital monopolies.

For example, in April 2015, the National Institute of Geographical and Forestry Information (IGN), the La Poste Group, the Secretariat-General for Government Modernization and OpenStreetMap France inaugurated a **collaborative national address database containing 20 million open data addresses**[^1]. It was released under a "share-alike‚Äù license by the French Postal Services (La Poste Group) and the IGN and under an ODBL license by the OpenStreetMap association. This agreement initiated a new chapter in the government's open data policy and the policy of open government, which goes beyond access to administrative documents. It involves supporting the creation and maintenance of major collaborative common assets to serve the economic dynamism, the efficiency of public service and the autonomy of citizens.

This effort is continuing with the development, still under ODBL license, of a database including all establishments open to the public, along with their characteristics.

### Roadmap

**France is experimenting innovative means of policy regulation through data platforms**: the Bill No. 2014-1104 dated 1 October 2014 **concerning taxis and chauffeur-driven transport cars[^2] instituted (article 1) the creation of a public registry** which lists information on the identification, availability and geolocation of taxis. Operated by Etalab in connection with the Ministry of the Interior, its purpose is to improve access to taxis by promoting the development of innovative services. It is based on an API allowing taxi geolocation operators and mobile search engines to improve their services. It will be available at the end of 2015.
