# Commitment 10

## Provide citizens new means to participate in public life by involving them in the identification of problems

### "_Fix My Neighborhood_"

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of State for the Digital Sector, attached to the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector
- Ministry of State for Urban Policy, attached to the Minister of Urban Affairs, Youth and Sport

#### Stakes

Beyond the consultation of citizens, open government is also based on other forms of participation: **platforms enabling citizens to report problems and incidents** or enabling them to contribute to the knowledge of certain phenomena. Such platforms lead the government to deal with problems that are effectively noticed, verified and reported by citizens.

These forms of crowdsourcing relate to concrete issues: reporting problems and incidents on public roads, reporting undesirable effects of medicines on [medicaments.gouv.fr](http://www.medicaments.gouv.fr/), which will include soon the possibility of reporting undesirable effects of any products and activities related to health, the practice of participative sciences ([SPIPOLL](http://www.spipoll.org/) project, etc.), development of "citizens' sensors" to share environmental measurements, etc.

#### Context & Aim

Numerous towns throughout the world allow citizens to report urban malfunctions from mobile terminals: graffiti, bulky objects abandoned, dangerous crossroads, maintenance of roads, pavements, trees and gardens, connectivity, defective traffic lights and public lighting… Once a problem is identified, the user selects the type of incident in the application, takes a photo that the GPS will geo-locate to complete the description, and automatically sends it to the relevant service. It is then the town services’ responsibility to provide a solution to the problems reported.

There are a large number of initiatives and platforms throughout the world (FixMyStreet, PublicStuff, ConnectedBits, ClickSeeFix, etc.) and in France: [Beecitiz](http://www.beecitiz.com/), [Jaidemaville](http://jaidemaville.com/), Dansmarue (Ville de paris), [Fixmaville](http://www.fixmaville.fr/), [Tellmycity](http://www.tellmycity.com/), Openmap, proxibuzz, GRC-Mobile (Localeo)…

Amongst the 60 measures decided by the **Interministerial Committee for Equality and Citizenship** on March 6th, 2015, was the launch of a call for projects for  "**Fix My Neighborhood**" (_Fix-It Des Quartiers_): a crowdsourcing platform dedicated to problems encountered by inhabitants and local associations[^1].

The objective is to provide municipalities with a simple digital solution for reporting (through web or smartphone) incidents and monitoring their resolution (back office). The municipalities that decide to implement this solution will be supported and trained.

Funded as part of the “Programme d’Investissements d’avenir[^2]” (Investments for the Future program), the " Fix My Neighborhood" call for projects will launch “innovation challenges” for start-ups. While working on the response to the challenge, the start-up will include a young innovator in its team. Depending on the subject they choose to address, participatory funding may supplement public funding.

#### Roadmap

- Launch the "Fix My Neighborhood" call for projects in June 2015
- Make a first version of the digital solution for reporting incidents available in September 2015 (objective: 100 municipalities involved before the end of the year)
- In mid-2016, launch the solutions that may be generalized

### _Digital Fix-it_

**Lead institution**:
- Prime Minister’s Office

#### Context & Aim

In the digital realm, contributive and crowd sourced efforts to identify problems is a good approach to ensure strong cyber security. Citizens will be offered the possibility to contribute to the identification of incidents (various cyber security incidents, notably website defacement). Named "**Digital Fix-it**", this project, conducted by Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (the French Cybersecurity Agency), will focus on state-controlled and semi-public websites.

#### Roadmap

- An experimental reporting platform will be put in place during 2016
- The platform will be open to the public by the end of 2016
