# Commitment 14

## Strengthen mediation and citizens' ability to act in matters relating to justice

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Justice

### Stakes

Justice aims at being responsive to the needs of social relations. **More effective justice, different avenues of appeal, and rules for amicable litigation, contribute to an open government**. Nowadays, justice must be open to society in order to explain its operation, its constraints, and its priorities. Justice must also incorporate the needs and feedback of citizens in order to improve itself.

### Context & Aim

**The “Justice of the 21st century” reform** is a commitment of the French Minister of Justice developed with magistrates, justice officials, the legal professions, academia, members of Parliament, local elected officials, and trade union organizations.

After 18 months of joint work, a [national debate](http://www.justice.gouv.fr/la-justice-du-21e-siecle-12563/10-et-11-janvier-2014-debats-publics-12748/) brought together close to 2,000 people on  January 10th and 11th 2014 at the head office of UNESCO in Paris. Following these two days of analysis, scenarios for judicial reform were sent to legal jurisdictions and professions. On September 10th 2004, the French Minister of Justice presented fifteen actions to the Council of Ministers to ensure that justice is more accessible, more effective, and provides a greater protection.

One of the measures announced was the ability for citizens to help improve their access to justice by forming jurisdiction councils, which will include association representatives.

Another objective for improving the public justice system is to strengthen conciliation and mediation[^1] across France, so as to allow citizens to settle disputes without automatically going to court.

Finally, results and information on decisions made by national courts will be made available to the public so that citizens can have greater autonomy in their relationship with the justice system and better assess the appropriateness of taking legal action.

### Roadmap

- **Opening up justice to society via the formation of jurisdiction councils**
    - Create jurisdiction councils within courts of first instance and courts of appeal to facilitate a joint analysis of common issues such as jurisdictional assistance, access to the law, access to justice, conciliation, mediation, and assistance to victims. Chaired by jurisdiction leaders, these jurisdiction councils will bring together public prosecutors and magistrates, jurisdiction and prison management officials, judicial protection for young persons, local elected representatives and representatives from trade union organizations, local government representatives, and representatives from the legal professions, local authorities, and associations

    - In certain civil litigation cases (those relating to alimony, compensatory allowance, compensation for bodily harm, etc.), information on judgments usually handed down by national jurisdictions will be made available to the public
    - On a local level, pilot jurisdictions have formed a partnership with universities in order to analyze their jurisprudence. Useful to magistrates to ensure that their judgments are consistent, these analyses will also provide lawyers and citizens with a document that facilitates their procedures and a possible amicable resolution to their dispute
