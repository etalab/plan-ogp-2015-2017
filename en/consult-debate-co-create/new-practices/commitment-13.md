# Commitment 13

## Leverage previous consultations & reform participatory mechanisms

**Lead institutions**:
- Prime Minister’s Office; Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister
- National Commission for Public Debate

### Stakes

**The informed participation of citizens in the process of public decision-making** is based on the ability of administrations to facilitate the understanding, by each of them, of the functioning of institutions and their activity, to open resources that can be used by them and to effectively mobilize their contribution.

As emphasized by France Stratégie in the report on Tomorrow’s Public Action[^1]: "_Society is willing to endow citizens’ decisional bodies with real powers, in addition to representative democracy_". Participative arrangements have become numerous, in very diverse formats. "_Properly run, these approaches contribute to rebuilding trust within the population because they embody the principle of questioning citizens_".

Public stakeholders should then be able to capitalize on consultations already carried out, and be able to easily mobilize tools for dialogue and consultation, and effectively integrate them into the process of the development of public decision-making.  

Also, citizens expect, in return for their commitment, greater openness of consultations to a renewed set of actors, with the terms of the debate clearly explained, and clear and transparent information on the rules for the consultation, particularly on the use and consequences of their contributions.

### Context & Aim

French citizens have access, via the **portal [vie-publique.fr](http://www.vie-publique.fr/)**, which is produced, published and managed by the Legal and Administrative Information Department (DILA), to useful resources and data to **understand the main subjects that are driving public debate**. Organized under three sections, "actualités (news)", "repères (points of reference)" and "ressources (resources)", it provides a vast amount of information on public life, the functioning of institutions and topical subjects being debated (government projects, current arrangements, developments of society or institutions, etc.).

Since November 2014, the site has also been listing the main debates, consultations and public forums across the territory, as well as the final summaries when they exist. The "DebatesCore[^2]" standard, finalized for this listing, groups online public debates or those that provide documentation online, as well as consultations opened over the Internet by the State, its public institutions or local and regional authorities prior to the adoption of a legislative text. Debatscore thus enables better debate traceability and individual tracking in consultations already carried out.

**Attentiveness to citizens and users feedback and the use of consultative tools and mechanisms** have been widely developed in the ministries. For example, the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research has implemented, for the definition of the common foundation, the reform of the curricula and the national consultation on digital matters, consultation mechanisms involving the entire teaching profession as well as the stakeholders concerned by the various subjects (for example, in digital matters, local authorities, parents, civil society, the digital industries, etc.)

Despite such initiatives, citizens and users sometimes feel that they have been consulted too late, or have not really been listened to, causing many of them to refuse to get involved in further consultations. In its public report "_Consulter autrement, participer effectivement_[^3]", the Council of State "_called for an administration qualified as "deliberative" because it seeks to develop, beyond formal consultations which should be simplified, new procedures characterized by transparency, openness, public debate and accountability_".

_"So that large numbers of citizens take part in a consultation, they must be given guarantees on the traceability and use of their contributions"_

_[Contribution #2707](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/95/avis/2707)_

_"Harmonise the details of the consultation procedures: deadlines sufficiently long and outside summer periods, publication of all contributions received and the list of organisations that took part in the consultation, choice criteria for analysis made transparent"_

_[Contribution #2875](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/95/avis/2875)_

_"Create obligatory recourse to a citizens' jury / consensus conference before any large project to reform the State. This citizens' jury, like juries in courts, would be composed of citizens chosen at random. After being informed and trained, they will participate in a debate on a subject of general interest and a consensus should emerge"_

### Roadmap

- **Capitalize on previous consultations: improve listing and strengthen accessibility to public debates that took place in France**
    - Continue the effort of listing public debates in France by extending the "DebatesCore"1 standard throughout the whole territory, to facilitate collection and accessibility, at a single access point, for consultations performed
      _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/155)]_
- **Empower public actors to successfully lead public consultations**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/156)]_
    - The Secretariat-General for Government Modernization is committed to proposing a simple and agile mechanism for consultation in the form of "Citizens' Workshops"
        - Carry out trials, with pilot ministries, of this mechanism, which is more flexible and agile than conventional consultation formats
        - Present, to partner administrations, the charter establishing the main principles of "Citizens' Workshops" and their implementation protocol
        - Support partner administrations in implementing these workshops
    - The Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy is committed to offering a "toolbox" to guide the institutions in choosing and implementing participative mechanisms
