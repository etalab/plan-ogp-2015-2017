# Commitment 17

## Transform Government's technological resources into an open platform

**Lead institutions**:
- Prime Minister's Office
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

Technological strategies of Internet giants demonstrate the benefits, for an organization, of approaches that are centered on openness, interoperability and agile systems that are focused on user-experience and on meeting users' needs, without hampering power and security.

Inspired by the principles of "_Government as a platform_", the **"Government as a Platform and France Connect" strategy consists** in undertaking a major technological transformation in order to facilitate access to data, the interoperability of systems and the reuse of developments made in the public sphere.

These principles offer new prospects because they unleash innovation in creating and designing new services, both for individuals and for companies.

### Context & Aim

By working on the **opening and interoperability of their own systems, administrations themselves become a resource for other administrations**. This approach goes beyond central administrations: welfare governmental administrators and local authorities must be fully involved in this effort. Furthermore, other players from civil society – companies, the associative sector – may contribute to enhancing the range of services.

This strategy is notably carried out by combining the publication, in open data, of public information that is not re-identifying and not subject to legal secrecy, the application of user control over personal data and the generalized construction of interfaces (API) to provide access to data or services already made available.

The Secretary General for Government Modernization (SGMAP) has submitted this strategy for public consultation, notably in the context of the consultation organized by the French Digital Council and, on June 18th 2015, has opened the website [etatplateforme.modernisation.gouv.fr](http://etatplateforme.modernisation.gouv.fr/). This platform encourages the creation of more open and collaborative public online services.

The "**France Connect**" module is an essential component of this strategy, respecting informational self-determination principle. It will allow users to choose a digital identity guaranteed by the State and associated with levels of trust aligned with the European eIDAS[^1] regulation. Access to all digital public services, or even more, will be facilitated according to the principles of the "single-sign-on" (SSO). Above all, thanks to this recognized identification mechanism, users will also control their own data exchanged between the various administrations or civil society players involved. Following the example of the simplification program "_Dites Le Nous une Fois_" (DLNuF or “_Provide it once_”), the first corollary is that a user – as an individual or a representative of a legal entity – will no longer have to present substantiating documents already known and produced by public organizations.

The implementation of **the Government as a Platform strategy will spread throughout each ministry**. For example, as part of the digital plan for education within the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research, the development of the digital ecosystem between teachers, pupils and parents will follow this platform strategy principle, in order to offer a reliable, easy-to use system facilitating cooperation between teachers, and to ensure that this ecosystem is open to all suppliers of digital content and services in an equitable manner, while guaranteeing the protection of students' personal data as well as the portability of their data and of their digital productions. Digital mechanisms implemented under this plan will follow these architectural principles, based on open APIs.

### Roadmap

- **Validate the strategic framework "Government as a Platform and France Connect" and apply its main principles during the year 2015 in the general reference systems or standards documents issued by the DISIC (Interministerial Directorate for Information and Communications Systems)**

    - The France Connect project will hold first trials in autumn 2015, followed by a launch in January 2016 on the portal www.service-public.fr (several million users)
    - Generalization will take place from 2016
- **Launch public forge on Etatplateforme.gouv.fr website, along with a repository of open API before the end of the 2015 year, in order to encourage the creation, in a collaborative manner, of new public services**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/167)]_
- **Launch several cycles of awareness-raising for the development of APIs and the creation of new services amongst actors in the public sphere and its partners**
