# Commitment 15

## Strengthen government policy on the opening and circulation of data

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister
- Ministry of State for the Digital Sector, attached to the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector

### Stakes

France, its government and its local and regional authorities are strongly committed to opening and sharing public data. This essential policy is both a driver of democratic vitality, a strategy for aiding economic and social innovation and a real lever for government modernization.

### Context & Aim

**The Government already shares numerous data pertaining at the core of the democratic, economic and social life**: access to law, public statistics, transparency of public expenditure, meteorological data, geographical data, land-registry data, etc.

According to the OECD, France is now in the second rank of countries that have made most progress in matters of open data[^1].

The Government has committed to a **strong policy on data** that favors the modernization of democratic practices and strengthens opportunities for innovation amongst public and private players.

Stakes and challenges relating to the opening of public data have now gone beyond the first stages of implementation (founding of the Etalab mission and the portal data.gouv.fr, creation of the function of Chief Data Officer...): public action should now be focused on building a right to public data, as world economies and governmental practices are evolving ever more rapidly thanks to the digital revolution.

These open data policies can also be extended to **local and regional authorities**: numerous local authorities, pioneers in the open data movement since 2008, willingly committed to opening and sharing public data. Some thirty of them came together in 2013 within the Open Data France Association[^2], in order to support actors engaged in open data and encourage the promotion of this policy  (see also [commitment 1](en/ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-1.md)).

Work will continue on the opening of **data of general interest**: public actors currently covered by the scope of the CADA Bill of July 17th 1978 are not the only ones to hold data useful to society or the economy. The report[^3] presented by Francis Jutand as part of the themed debate on transport data highlighted the extent of information of general interest, defined as "_produced in the context of services to the public, for which opening is considered of general interest, because it enables the implementation of new public services_". The information on activities of general interest or with strong externalities could be made available as open data, while respecting legal secrecy, principles of free competition, protection of personal data and private life.

It is also to be noted that in September 2014, the Prime Minister established the function of **Chief Data Officer** at the national level. The State itself must learn to best use the data it possesses, in order to open data of high quality in the most relevant formats, define the forthcoming data which should be opened or produced, judiciously use this data to support decision-making and the public debate, treat the protection of privacy and the various legal secrets with the seriousness it deserves, and keep the promise of an improvement in the efficiency of public action through opening public data,

The Chief Data Officer must therefore oversee the quality of data produced by the State, define then gradually organize governance of the data, and initiate in the administrations a genuine ability to design and disseminate data-driven public policies as well as to use data in public policy assessments.

> "'Pivot data' or 'reference data' are data considered as identifying data, by the administration or according to custom, for naming or identifying products, economic entities or territories. These references are essential for linking databases of a heterogeneous nature and constructing any new service integrated with the web of data (Linked Open Data) (…) The GFII proposes, on its site, a [first list of this pivot data, by sector](http://www.gfii.fr/uploads/docs/GFII_Donneespivots.pdf)."

_GFII [contribution #1905](http://contribuez.cnnumerique.fr/debat/114/avis/1905)_

> "Redesign the governance of key data, particularly its funding model: the proper organization of a State is based on a set of basic data used routinely, primarily data on the organization of society, its territory, its individuals, its companies. (…) In France, there is still little connection between the key registers, which are not sufficiently reused. Most of them do not constitute a unique source of information. In the digital era, such a situation indisputably represents a significant obstacle to efforts to modernize the State."

### Roadmap

- **Continue the opening of data that have a strong economic and social impact, particularly "pivotal data"**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/162)]_
- **Strengthen open data in local and regional authorities: Enshrine in law the obligation to publish the public information of local authorities of more than 3,500 inhabitants** (including municipalities and public institutions for inter-municipal cooperation)
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/163)]_
- **Enshrine in law the principles of default opening of public data (with closure being exceptional) and its unrestricted and cost-free reuse**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/164)]_
- **Improve the opportunity study on the opening of " general interest data”**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/165)]_
