# Open Digital Resources

Sharing technological resources such as data, software or calculation models in an open and easy to reuse way is a great lever for social and economic innovation, allows a diversification of opinions and initiates new forms of collaboration with citizens.

Data sharing can only be conceived within a framework ensuring the respect of the right to privacy, for which France has equipped itself with a strong legal and institutional bedrock, notably with the bill nÂ°78-17 from January 6th, 1978, on information technology, data files and civil liberties.

If there is a key teaching from the digital revolution, it is the ability of citizens to self-organize to address challenges and develop solutions together. It is fundamental for public authorities to encourage and foster this process by sharing the resources it can open to all, and by being able to forge new alliances with this multitude of potential contributors.

In an extension of its policy of openness and sharing of public data, which has already led to the deployment of an open and contributory open data platform ([data.gouv.fr](http://www.data.gouv.fr/)), to the coproduction of data with citizens and to guaranteeing the availability of informational common goods, the Government will pursue this course of action:

- By working on the development and availability of essential resources, including reference data, as well as models for decision-making and public action,
- By developing a government technology strategy in accordance with the "government as a platform" approach, opening up IT resources of the State to make them easier to use, more progressive, and more efficient,
- By continuing the development of digital administration and the dematerialization of public services, pillars of the e-government which open up new channels for interaction with users and allow further improvements.
