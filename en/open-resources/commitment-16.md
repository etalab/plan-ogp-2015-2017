# Commitment 16

## Promote the opening of calculation models & simulators

**Lead institution**:
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

**Open data policies are supplemented by the opening of rules, algorithms and models that accompany it and support public decision-making**. These algorithms and models are a powerful means of promoting independent points of view. When they are open (open source) and can be used through APIs, they also constitute a precious resource for developing numerous applications.

### Context & Aim

Public officials routinely use numerous models to calculate social benefits, taxes, pensions, economic growth, etc. Some of these are made available to citizens for calculations on eligibility for benefits or evaluations of forthcoming contributions. Too often, these models coexist within administrations, without being shared. The use of open models, for which the code is accessible, reusable, applicable and can be improved by a community as well as by the administrations themselves, can break down barriers within the administration and contribute to a process of cooperation and open innovation.

In 2014, the Secretariat-General for Government Modernization and France Strat√©gie developed and made available to the community the **[OpenFisca](http://www.openfisca.fr/) platform**, an open search engine and an open API allowing **micro-simulation of the French tax and social benefit system**. This is the first entirely-open model developed by the administration: it encodes, in a tool accessible to everyone, the principles of open government, since it serves:

- Transparency: each citizen can see the rules and parameters of the legislation, the distribution that she receives and the breakdown of her contribution to the system
- The stimulation of diverse points of view and the efficiency in public decision-making, because administrations, researchers and journalists, among others, can simulate the impact of reforms
- Government modernization, because the tool could be adapted to themed simulators, to facilitate the action of the administrations themselves. For instance, the portal [mes-aides.gouv.fr](https://mes-aides.gouv.fr/) was built from OpenFisca and provides a simulator on welfare and social benefits, which is particularly useful in ensuring all citizens can claim the benefits they are entitled to.

### Roadmap

- **Extend the opening of models to other areas of public action**
    - Continue to work with the different administrations to support them in opening their calculation and simulation models

- **Produce simulators from existing open models**
    - Leverage the OpenFisca platform to extend it to other areas of legislation and propose adaptations of simulators useful to citizens, economic players and public players. For example, simulation model for energy costs, extension of local taxation, pension calculations, etc.
