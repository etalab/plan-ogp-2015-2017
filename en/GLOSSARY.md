# API (Application Programming Interface)

For data, this is usually a way provided by the data publisher for programs or apps to read data directly over the web. The app sends the API a query asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving bandwidth and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.

# Commons

"Commons" are resources that are managed by a community which defines usage rights, organizes its own governance, and works to protect resources devoted to collective usage against private propriety. It can be a local community managing hard resources (ex: shared garden) or a global community managing soft resources (ex: Wikipedia). The “commons” approach can be an alternative governance mode to the one offered by the State or private actors.

# Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet

# Crowdsourcing

Dividing the work of collecting a substantial amount of data into small tasks that can be undertaken by volunteers. For example, Wikipedia is a crowd-sourced encyclopedia.

# Data portability

Data portability is the ability for people to reuse their data that have been created through their own use of a service. Thus, it is the ability for people to be able to control their identity, media and other forms of personal data. Their data can then be used for their personal purposes or can be given to another organization through interoperable applications.

# Data Science

Data Science is the extraction of knowledge from large volumes of data that are structured or unstructured. Data science employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information theory and information technology, including signal processing, probability models, machine learning, data mining, database, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, predictive analytics, etc.

# Data visualization

Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects (e.g., points, lines or bars) contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users.

# Forge

In the Open Source development community, a forge is a web-based collaborative software platform for both sharing computer applications and developing them.

# Hackathon

An event, usually over one or two days, where developers, subject experts and others come together to create apps, visualizations and prototypes that aim to address problems in a particular domain, usually making heavy use of data. The hackathon is a popular format in the open source community.

# Interoperability

Relating to systems, especially of computers or telecommunications, that are capable of working together without being specially configured to do so.

# Machine Readable

A machine-readable format can be understood by a computer that can extract, transform and process the information and data
(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_data)

# Metadata

Information about a dataset such as its title and description, method of collection, author or publisher, area and time period covered, license, date and frequency of release, etc. It is essential to publish data with adequate metadata to aid both discoverability and usability of the data.

# Normative Footprint

The normative footprint is the fact of attaching to a regulatory text the list of persons that were heard or that contributed to the drafting or introduction of a legal text.

# ODbL

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a "Share Alike" license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use a database, for public or commercial purposes, while maintaining this same freedom for others, and mentioning the database when it generates new creation. The Open Database License is a product of the opendatacommons.org project from the Open Knowledge Foundation.

# Open Data

Data is open if it can be freely accessed, used, modified and shared by anyone for any purpose – subject only, at most, to requirements to provide attribution and/or share-alike. Specifically, open data is defined by the Open Definition and requires that the data be A. Legally open: that is, available under an open (data) license that permits anyone freely to access, reuse and redistribute B. Technically open: that is, that the data be available for no more than the cost of reproduction and in machine-readable and bulk form.

# Open Data Camp

An event where people with different competences (civil servants, developers, innovators, researchers...) collaboratively work, on a specific project or problem (apps creation, public policy analysis...) using open data. See examples: https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/tag/open-data-camp

# Open Lab

Open labs are spaces open to everyone, for collaborative and creative work, aiming at promoting the culture of experimentation and open innovation. In the public sector, open labs intend to gather civil servants and external actors (from the private sector, designers, researchers...) to work on collaborative projects. These labs function with agile methods where anyone is free to contribute the way he wants.

# Open Source

Software for which the source code is available under an open license. Not only can the software be used for free, but users with the necessary technical skills can inspect the source code, modify it and run their own versions of the code, helping to fix bugs, develop new features, etc. Some large open source software projects have thousands of volunteer contributors. The Open Definition was heavily based on the earlier Open Source Definition, which sets out the conditions under which software can be considered open source.

# Referential Data

Referential data (or "pivot data") are data that are used to name or identify entities (for example products, economic entities, locations, stakeholders, legal entities...). These reference systems are necessary to link together datasets that are not configured to work together, and to build unified information architecture.
