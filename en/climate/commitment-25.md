# Commitment 25

## Open data and models related to climate and sustainable development

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- Minister of State for State Reform and Simplification attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

Opening data and models related to climate and sustainable development will serve to:

- Educate and raise awareness of citizens concerning climate issues, with data visualizations or applications, which could illustrate the major challenges regarding climate (to be used by journalists, researchers and all interested actors)
- Support civil society representatives and NGOs positions
- Stimulate economic and social innovation and allow third-parties to develop innovative solutions to climate challenges.

### Context & Aim

A document was published in November 2014 on the occasion of the **Environmental Conference** to prepare the 2015 roadmap that the Government will use to define the national application of the contribution of the European Union to the universal agreement on climate. This document states (Point 56) that "_in order to mobilize players of digital civil society, researchers and media, the government will open datasets relating to the topics debate. They will be published on data.gouv.fr several months before the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. It will encourage its foreign partners to do likewise_".

### Roadmap

- **Provide on the platform data.gouv.fr data, models and simulators regarding climate, energy transition and sustainable development**
- **Release and publish data from impact assessment studies realized by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy**
