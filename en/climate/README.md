# Open Government for Climate and Sustainable Development

In 2015, France will be hosting and presiding the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21/CMP11), otherwise known as “Paris 2015”. COP21 will be a crucial conference, as it needs to achieve a new international agreement on the climate, applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C.

Based on the experience of its own commitment, France can actively contribute to changing the spirit of negotiations with the aim of a 2015 Paris Climate agreement. One way is by emphasizing the "Positive agenda", meaning an "Agenda of Solutions".  This agenda illustrates the benefits, for the climate, for the economy and for the well-being of everyone, of numerous tangible initiatives that are increasing throughout the world, often at the initiative of towns and local authorities sharing their best practices in active and creative international networks.

During his address to the annual summit of the OGP in New York on 24 September 2014, the President of the French Republic François Hollande emphasized the importance of building new alliances with civil society in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century: “_we can make the climate conference a success if there is transparency, and if there is coordination between governments and civil society_”.

The commitments accepted therefore aim:

1. To strongly associate civil society with the Conference and its preparation; to promote transparency concerning the agenda and negotiations: agendas of meetings, events, negotiating bodies represented…
2. To provide resources (data, models) regarding climate, before the COP21 conference. The opening and common availability of these data and models could serve to:
    - Educate and raise awareness of citizens concerning climate issues, with datavisualizations or applications which could illustrate the major challenges regarding climate (to be used by journalists...);
    - Provide data to support civil society representatives positions;
    - Allow third-party players to propose innovative solutions to climate challenges. 
3. To launch a "Climate Challenge" – at the occasion of the COP21 – which will reward start-ups or innovators providing innovative solutions to climate challenges. A similar challenge will be developed similarly in Mexico.
