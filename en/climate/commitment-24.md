# Commitment 24

## Involve civil society in the COP21 conference and promote transparency regarding the agenda and negotiations

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- National Commission for Public Debate

### Stakes

The COP21 French chairmanship will aim to be exemplary in listening to civil society. The strong mobilization of citizens and non-governmental actors (local and regional authorities, private sector, NGOs, scientists, etc.,) in the action for climate is a priority.

Transparency on the preparation of the Conference and in its implementation is a corollary of civil society's commitment.

### Context & Aim

In December 2014, the General secretariat in charge of preparing and organizing the COP21 launched a **consultation intended for [all representatives of groups constituted from civil society](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/civil-society)**. This consultation gathered opinions and recommendations concerning the implementation of the area dedicated to civil society on the [Le Bourget site](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/pratical-arrangements/paris-le-bourget-site), the overall organization of the event and its programming. This initiative, which closed in January 2015 and was the first in the history of the preparation of a COP, enabled the collection, far in advance, of suggestions from the [nine groups of “observers”](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/civil-society) that were constituted as well as from the 117 organizations that took part in this consultation, including numerous international groups and coalitions (environmental and international solidarity NGOs and the business sector).

A **"village" dedicated to civil society** will thus be held at Le Bourget. It will be accessible without accreditation, in contrast to the official negotiation enclosures. Regular meetings will be organized with the representatives of civil society (NGOs, companies, unions…) in order to continue to gather all opinions and incorporate all good will participation to the success of the conference.

Furthermore, it is proposed to give greater visibility to the numerous initiatives run by civil society and non-governmental players, through a **list of “[COP21 certified” projects](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/civil-society/labelling-process-and-project-support)** on the Conference's site.

Run by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, the **global public debate**, involving 75 countries on the same day, on 6 June 2015, was also the greatest citizens' consultation ever carried out on climate and energy. This event enabled more than 10,000 citizens throughout the entire world to seek information, discuss, reach an informed opinion and give their views on the five key subjects of the negotiations in the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21).

First elements contribute to provide transparency on the preparation of the conference and the progress of negotiations:  
The list of all observers accepted by the United Nations is accessible on the site of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ([non-governmental organizations](http://maindb.unfccc.int/public/ngo.pl?mode=wim&search=A) and [intergovernmental organizations](http://maindb.unfccc.int/public/igo.pl?mode=wim)).

The [timetable of climate events](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/media-facilities/press-room/de-lima-paris-calendrier-des-evenements-climat) has been put online on the COP21 website.

A report on the content of the main international meetings on the topics of the environment and sustainable development is accessible via the [Earth Negotiations Bulletin](http://www.iisd.ca/climate/adp/adp2-8/) produced by the [Reporting Services of the International Institute for Sustainable Development](http://www.iisd.ca), for which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development funded the French translation

The [guide to information for civil society](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Guide_d_informations_societe_civile_COP21v8_cle81c47e.pdf) is available on the COP21 site (French version).

This process of transparency and dialogue with civil society will be extended after the COP21 Conference.

### Roadmap

- **Bring together civil society's representatives before each informal negotiating meeting**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/194)]_
    - A [first meeting](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Au-Bourget-pour-les-lyceens-c-est.html?var_mode=calcul) was organized before the informal session on climate negotiations on 6-8 May 2015, with civil society (French and international NGOs, representatives of unions at the UN…) in order to present the work and the state of progress of negotiations and take part in the discussion
    - New meetings will take place alongside the forthcoming negotiation sessions
- **Create a participatory platform to mobilize civil society in preparation for COP 21, which may be extended to other consultations**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/195)]_
    - Between June and November 2015, draft a first version, with the aim of:
        - raising awareness of environmental dialogue and the main stakes of the energy transition
        - organize a network involving inhabitants, action groups, project holders, companies, local authorities and stakeholders
        - facilitate contacts and cooperation between the various players in environmental e-citizenship, including through online exchanges
        - create decentralized cooperation and develop a community of players in environmental e-citizenship
        - collect the suggestions and opinions of Internet users to allow the collaborative listing of local initiatives and constitute a broad database
    - Develop of a second version of the platform in order to ensure that citizens' mobilization lasts beyond COP 21. This second version could be extended further to support future citizens' consultations led by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- **Continue the consultation on climate issues in order to follow up on from the global citizens' debate on 6 June 2015, which assembled more than 10,000 citizens from 75 countries**
