# Commitment 26

## Initiate new collaborations with civil society to develop innovative solutions to meet the challenges of climate and sustainable development

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification, attached to the Prime Minister

### Stakes

In addition to the international agreement expected in Paris, concrete initiatives bringing together governments and non-governmental actors could be developed. This “Agenda of Solutions”[^1], aims to support and intensify the commitments of States in reducing greenhouse gases, in adapting to the impact of climate disruption and in funding these actions.

### Context & Aim

Numerous initiatives will be promoted in this agenda. Amongst them, a major innovation process has begun in France, the **C3 or "Climate Change Challenge"** ([c3challenge.com](http://c3challenge.com/)) initiative. C3 aims to stimulate the emergence of innovations promoting the use of data and services. The program seeks to create a lasting effect over time, stimulating and organizing collaboration between entities owning information and know-how and data reusers (public and private economic actors, regions, general public) in order to:

- Bring forward innovative solutions related to understanding, prevention and adaptation to climate change;
- Raise public awareness on climate change and turn the public into actors involved in the challenge;
- Open and organize the dialogue between stakeholders in climate change in a participatory approach;
- Allow the collaborative involvement of everyone in the search for solutions to the problems and opportunities caused by climatic change;
- Discover and test new strategies for the provision of data, knowledge and know-how

### Roadmap

- **Launch and organize the first stages of the C3 operation throughout 2015**
- **Reward the winners of the C3 operation during the COP21 Conference**
    - Laureates of the C3 challenge organized in parallel by the Mexican government will also be present in Paris
- **Continue the operation in 2016 and 2017**
    - Monitor and support the best innovative projects  capitalize on the best challenges to issue new calls for proposal, perpetuate online tools for expression by citizens
