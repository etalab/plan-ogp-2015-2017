# Foreword

_"A Government of the people, by the people, for the people"_: such is the principle of our
Republic. Living up to this ambition is a constant effort, one that each era should renew for
the Republic to remain always faithful to its promise of progress.

Too many of our fellow citizens might doubt about our institutions, their leaders, in fact the
capacity of the public sector to face the big challenges of our times. Only through the
revitalization of our democracy will we be able to meet these challenges: the challenge of
globalization, of the environment, of a more fraternal society, of a digital world in which on
one hand everything goes faster, and on the other hand, involvement opportunities are
multiplied.

An opened and connected world calls for modern institutions, simple decision-making
processes, and a reinvented democracy. This is the ambition of the Open Government
Partnership.

It builds on three principles:
- The integrity of public servants, guaranteed by further requirements in terms of
  transparency, because exemplarity is not only a moral obligation but also a crucial
  precondition when aiming at restoring public trust in institutions,
- The opening of public decision-making in order to have more cooperative, more
  publicly debated, more collective decisions and as a result, fairer more efficient and
  better understood: this is how we will revitalize democracy.
- The opening of public action, in order to involve civil society in the construction of
  common good, along with the State and public authorities.

France has come a long way in the opening of its democracy, since the citizenship of women
in 1945 to the lowering of voting age to 18 years in 1974; by establishing representative bodies
of civil society such as the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (CESE) in 1927 or the
National Commission for Public Debate (CNDP) in 2002 and by creating institutions that
guarantee an exemplary performance of the Republic such as the Commission for access to
administrative documents (CADA) in 1978, the National Commission for the monitoring of
campaign accounts and political finances (CNCCFP) in 1990, or the High Authority for
Transparency in Public Life (HATVP) in 2013.

Through the Open Government Partnership, France intends to confirm its will to be at the
avant-garde of public action modernization.

France is at the avant-garde thanks to the methodology used to open up the public sector to
the comments and initiatives of civil society.

France is at the avant-garde through its practices, such as this action plan. Elaborated
through consultation and trust, it proposes several tangible improvements and draws very
ambitious perspectives that we will attain together with the Partnership’s Independent
Reporting Mechanism.

This document is a first step. Many more are to follow for the values of the Republic to
continue to guide us towards a more inclusive and dynamic society, always more confident
in its future.
