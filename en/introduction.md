# Introduction

France joined the Open government Partnership (OGP) in April 2014. The OGP promotes public action transparency and openness based on participation and collaboration between the public sector and civil society.

This initiative complements the work done by the French government on State reform and simplification. In fact, at the heart of our project is the ambition to improve the relationship between the state and the citizens, between the state and businesses, to use technology to enhance efficiency and transparency and to reinvigorate our democracy. This reform has clear and ambitious goals: to renew trust in public action through increased transparency, to revitalize social dialogue with a collaborative approach that gives democracy means for greater proximity and a better quality of service for citizens, businesses and stakeholders.
The digital revolution offers an opportunity to give full meaning to the values of the Republic by reinventing public action for the benefit of all.

Thanks to our strong commitment to French citizens, we choose to raise this issue at the international level through this plan. France, thanks to its experience, aims to be at the forefront of this movement for a democracy renewed by transparency and collaborative dialogue.

This project is in line with our democratic tradition and our ability to renovate public action. It is also a very promising field for exchanging mutual experiences with partner countries. The OGP is a platform enabling us to act more and faster for these values and topics on which our republican pact is built.  

This "National plan for transparent and collaborative public action" represents, for us, a major step.

It is the result of a long consultation process engaged with civil society, within government and the administration, and with independent authorities. It is based on five major chapters:

**Ensure accountability** to improve transparency, restore trust and make better public policies. Transparency is demanded from authorities through commitments relating to public decisions, local finances ([commitment 1](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-1.md)) and public procurement ([commitment 2](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-2.md)). It is also demanded from businesses, notably in order to effectively fight money laundering, tax evasion and corruption ([commitment 7](ensure-accountability/economic-life-transparency/commitment-7.md)). This effort reaches the international realm with particular consideration to public development aid and international negotiations (commitments [3](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-3.md), [9](ensure-accountability/economic-life-transparency/commitment-9.md)).

**Consultation, debates and the co-creation of public action** are based on renewed participatory mechanisms to involve citizens in the making of public action. In order to modernize and revitalize our democracy, we must create the conditions for constant exchange with citizens, organizations and businesses, for instance with new collaborative mechanisms to identify problems in a neighborhood ([commitment 10](consult-debate-co-create/public-action/commitment-10.md)) or to open the elaboration of the law ([commitment 12](consult-debate-co-create/public-action/commitment-12.md)). The citizen takes an active role in public policy evaluation (commitments [13](consult-debate-co-create/new-practices/commitment-13.md), [14](consult-debate-co-create/new-practices/commitment-14.md)). This is the application of collective intelligence to public action!

**Open digital resources** for economic and social innovation thanks to the sharing of data ([commitment 15](open-resources/commitment-15.md)) and even calculation models themselves ([commitment 16](open-resources/commitment-16.md)). Our aim is to go further on this path by transforming the State’s technological resources into an open platform ([commitment 17](open-resources/commitment-17.md)). Finally, digital administration is a remarkable mean to enhance proximity and efficiency in public action ([commitment 18](open-resources/commitment-18.md)).

**Opening up the administration** itself will favor citizen engagement in support of the public sector, and in schools in particular ([commitment 19](open-public-administration/citizens-empowerment/commitment-19.md)). This openness implies assisting and supporting civil servants through the digital transition (commitments [21](open-public-administration/openness-and-innovation/commitment-21.md), [22](open-public-administration/openness-and-innovation/commitment-22.md)) and reinforcing their role and protection in the prevention of conflicts of interests ([commitment 23](open-public-administration/exemplary-behavior/commitment-23.md)).

Lastly, in the context of the COP21 conference that will take place in Paris in December 2015, the National Action Plan proposes to apply open government principles to **climate change and sustainable development**, as this challenge is particularly adapted to these new means and principles in governance (commitments [24](climate/commitment-24.md), [25](climate/commitment-25.md), [26](climate/commitment-26.md)).

Throughout this plan, France took a total of 26 commitments. In a year, a first assessment will be made. Lessons learned from this first plan will support the second version of the Action Plan. France will strive to make constant progress towards a government that is more open to consultation and citizen’s contributions.

The collaborative democracy to which we aspire to fully involves citizens in public action. This plan is, for France, a major step enabling us to go further in the respect and promotion of our core values.
