# Introduction

France joined the Open government Partnership (OGP) in April 2014. The OGP promotes
public action transparency and openness based on participation and collaboration
between the public sector and civil society.

This initiative complements the work done by the French government on State reform and
simplification. In fact, at the heart of our project is the ambition to improve the relationship
between the state and the citizens, between the state and businesses, to use technology to
enhance efficiency and transparency and to reinvigorate our democracy. This reform has
clear and ambitious goals: to renew trust in public action through increased transparency, to
revitalize social dialogue thanks to a collaborative approach that gives democracy means
for greater proximity and a better quality of service for citizens, businesses and stakeholders.

The digital revolution offers an opportunity to give full meaning to the values of the Republic
by reinventing public action for the benefit of all.

Thanks to our strong commitment towards French citizens, we now chose to raise this issue at
the international level through this plan. France, thanks to its experience, aims to be at the
forefront of this movement for a democracy renewed by transparency and collaborative
dialogue.

This project is in line with our democratic tradition and our ability to renovate public action. It
is also a very promising field for exchanging mutual experiences with partner countries. The
OGP is a tool that enables us to do more and do faster on these values and topics on which
our republican pact is built.

This "National plan for transparent and collaborative public action" represents, for us, a
major step.

It is the result of a long consultation process engaged with civil society, within government
and the administration, and with independent authorities. It is based on five major chapters:

**Accountability** to improve transparency, restore trust and make better public policies. The
duty of transparency is imposed to authorities through commitments relating to decisions,
local finances ([commitment 1](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-1.md))
and public procurement ([commitment 2](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-2.md)).
This requirement is also imposed to businesses in order to effectively fight money laundering,
tax evasion and corruption ([commitment 7](ensure-accountability/economic-life-transparency/commitment-7.md)).
This enhanced transparency reaches international exchanges
with particular efforts regarding public development aid and international negotiations
(commitments [3](ensure-accountability/public-expenditures-and-accounts-transparency/commitment-3.md),
[9](ensure-accountability/economic-life-transparency/commitment-9.md)).

**Consultation and the co-creating of public action** is based on the renewal of participatory
mechanisms involving citizens in the production of public action. In order to modernize and
revitalize our democracy, we need to create the conditions for constant exchange with
citizens, associations and businesses, for instance by identifying problems in a neighborhood
([commitment 10](consult-debate-co-create/public-action/commitment-10.md)) or by elaborating
the law ([commitment 12](consult-debate-co-create/public-action/commitment-12.md)).
The citizen becomes responsible for public policy evaluation
(commitments [13](consult-debate-co-create/new-practices/commitment-13.md),
[14](consult-debate-co-create/new-practices/commitment-14.md)).
This is the application of collective intelligence to public action!

**Shared digital resources** for economic and social innovation thanks to the availability of data
([commitment 15](open-resources/commitment-15.md)) and calculation models
([commitment 16](open-resources/commitment-16.md)). Our aim is to go further on this
path by transforming State technological resources into an open platform
([commitment 17](open-resources/commitment-17.md)).
Finally, digital administration is a remarkable mean to enhance proximity and efficiency in
public action ([commitment 18](open-resources/commitment-18.md)).

**Opening up the administration** itself will favor citizen engagement in support of the public
sector, namely in schools ([commitment 19](open-public-administration/citizens-empowerment/commitment-19.md)).
This openness implies helping civil servants in the digital transition(commitments
[21](open-public-administration/openness-and-innovation/commitment-21.md),
[22](open-public-administration/openness-and-innovation/commitment-22.md))
and reinforcing their role and protection in the prevention of conflicts of interests
([commitment 23](open-public-administration/exemplary-behavior/commitment-23.md)).

Lastly, in the context of the COP21 that will take place in Paris next December 15 th , the Plan
proposes an application of open government principles to a long term issue that is
particularly adapted to this new governance model: **climate change and sustainable
development** (commitments [24](climate/commitment-24.md), [25](climate/commitment-25.md),
[26](climate/commitment-26.md)).

France takes a total of 26 commitments. In one year, a first assessment will be made. The
lessons learned from this will support the second version of the action plan. We aim to
continue making progress towards a government that is more open to consultation and the
contribution of citizens, in a process of collective efficiency.

The collaborative democracy that we aspire to fully involves citizens in public action. This is,
for France, a major step that enables to go even further in the respect of our core values.
