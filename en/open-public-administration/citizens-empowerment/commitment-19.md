# Commitment 19

## Empower civil society to support schools

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research
- Ministry of Urban Affairs, Youth and Sport

### Stakes

School are opening themselves to contributions from citizens to provide their support to the transmission of the Republic’s values alongside public officials. This gives young volunteers for civic service an opportunity to participate in motivating and training actions amongst children and young people.

### Context & Aim

On February 5th of 2015, the President of the Republic committed to making the **civic service program** "universal" by June 1st 2015. The Minister of National Education, Higher Education and Research, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, and the Minister of Urban Affairs, Youth and Sport, Patrick Kanner, will launch in September 2015 a large “**service civique**” (**citizen service**) program devoted to public education. President Hollande also called for the establishment of a civic reserve and assigned to the vice-president of the Council of State, Mr Jean-Marc Sauvé and to the selector of the French handball team, Mr Claude Onesta, an expert mission on the matter.

On January 22nd of 2015, the Minister of National Education, Higher Education and Research Najat Vallaud-Belkacem stated that creating a civic reserve for the public education would be a key objective in the mobilization of schools for the values of the Republic. The program was launched on 12 May 2015, on the occasion of the national concluding summary of the schools forum for the values of the Republic[^1].

### Roadmap

- **Empower young people to get involved via new civic service missions within schools**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/174)]_

  The Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research has a recruitment objective of 5,000 young people for civic service at the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year and 10,000 volunteers in 2016-2017. By the beginning of the 2017 school year, the objective is to offer 37,000 missions including missions run by associations within the school and university field.

  Civic service within schools is aimed at young people between 18 and 25 years old. It is a voluntary commitment that can last from 6 to 12 months (average commitment being about 8 months), from October/November 2015 to June 2016. The missions take place in elementary schools, high school, information and orientation centers or local education authorities. Priority is given to missions in elementary schools, priority education and boarding schools.

  The voluntary work is done in most cases by pairs of volunteers when the mission is carried out before pupils and aims to allow experience of social diversity and contact with the public and other volunteers of diverse backgrounds.

  The nine main types of mission of volunteers for civic service are: contribution to educative, teaching and civic responsibility activities in primary school; support to projects for education in citizen matters; support to actions and projects in the fields of artistic and cultural education and sport; support to actions and projects for education in sustainable development; organization of the national education department's civic reserve; contribution to the organization of the free time of boarders in developing new activities; prevention of addictions; information and support to young people who are failing at school or who wish to resume qualifying training; help with providing information and orientation to pupils.

- **Allow citizens to support schools in the transmission of the Republic’s values: the national education department's civic reserve**
  _[[follow-up](https://git.framasoft.org/etalab/suivi/issues/175)]_

  This new arrangement (as outlined in the circular dated May 12th 2015[^2]) allows adults who desire to have the opportunity to dedicate their time and provide their experience to serve schools, particularly in the following fields of expertise:

  - Education in citizen matters and secularism (“laïcité”),
  - Education in gender equality,
  - Education in the media and information,
  - The fight against racism, anti-semitism and all forms of discrimination,
  - The connection between schools and the professional world.

  For schools, this is an opportunity to mobilize and benefit from civil society’s strengths beyond the various components of the educational community and actors who also act in of associations, civic service or in the form of ad hoc intervention. Teachers may therefore regularly call upon external speakers to illustrate their teaching within classes.

  The associations, and more generally, all people and legal entities wishing to promote the national education department's civic reserve can be associated as civic reserve’s ambassadors. Several institutions are already involved in the national education department's civic reserve (National School of administration, Conferences of the university presidents, CDEFI, CEMEA, League of education, CNOUS, "les Francas", French network of educational cities, Association of members of the Order of Academic Palms).

  Reservists are also called upon, if they wish, to intervene in extracurricular activities.
