# Open Up Public Administration

Over thirty years after the July 13th 1983 law on civil servants' rights and obligations, the Government intends to reaffirm the values of public service in a new bill. These values constitute one of the Republic's pillars, in the service of public action continuity and the enhancement of country cohesion. The Bill related to deontology and to the rights and obligations of civil servants will reinforce the links between citizens and the public service.

Adding the duty of integrity to the obligations of impartiality, dignity and probity that characterize public agents' functions, the bill will reinforce the role and the protection of public agents in the prevention of conflicts of interests.  

The opening up of the administration also relies on citizens' engagement in support of public authorities. In an emblematic way, the civil service and the National Education's citizen reserve offer an opportunity to bring their contribution to each citizen.

In order to reach its fullest potential, the Open Government policy should enable all public agent to become an actor of the modernization process, and should be anchored in an exemplary administration, opened to new talents and to innovative collaborations with civil society.  

In that regard, the government is committed to facilitate the recruitment of diverse profiles that reflect French society, thanks to an evolution of the entry selection mechanisms and to new ways of accessing public service.  

Growing a culture of openness and cooperation will also require awareness and training actions on the digital transition for all public agents throughout the territory.
