# Commitment 21

## Grow a culture of openness, data literacy and digital technologies

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service
- Ministry of State for State Reform and Simplification, attached to the Prime Minister
- Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA)

### Stakes

Public agents must be the actors of the changes enabled by the digital revolution, the open data policy and the open government policy.

### Context & Aim

**Actions to raise awareness and develop among public officials a data and digital literacy**, such as those already implemented by Etalab (Vademecum on the opening and sharing of public data[^1], "Bonjour Data" events[^2], open data camps…), by the Secretariat-General for Government Modernization (SGMAP), by ministries and by local and regional authorities, must be intensified.

The **civil service schools** are also committed to promoting the spread of culture of openness, data and innovation, by incorporating more training programs on digital matters and data.
