# Commitment 20

## Diversify recruitment within public institutions

**Lead institution**:
- Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service

### Stakes

The civil service has a duty to be exemplary by reflecting the French society it serves, with its diversity and its evolutions.

### Context & Aim

The State undertakes to facilitate the recruitment of diversified profiles that not only reflect French society, but also that are necessary to support the administrations through digital and open government evolutions.

### Roadmap

- **Develop new access channels to the civil service, to improve its opening to society**
    - In the Bill on ethics and the rights and obligations of civil servants, insert measures to renew access channels to civil service and open them a larger diversity of profiles
    - Renew the preparatory classes mechanism for access to competitive examinations of category A in the three branches of the civil service, particularly by increasing by 25% the number of places offered in the integrated preparatory classes preparing candidates for the competitive examinations for entry to the civil service from 2015. The objective for 2016 is to double the number of students, to reach 1,000 places
    - Develop apprenticeship in the civil service by multiplying by 10 the number of apprentices, to reach an objective of 4,000 by the beginning of the 2016 school year and 10,000 for 2017
- **Address discriminatory biases upon entry into the civil service**
    - Upon request from the Prime Minister, launch an expert appraisal mission on discrimination issues
    - Modify the texts on juries and selection committeeâ€™s composition for each ministry to open them to at least one member outside the recruiting administration
    - Generalize training courses on discrimination prevention for all future members of juries and selection committees
    - Generalize the procedures for the quality certification of human resources departments in order to evaluate all their procedures with regard to any discriminatory risks
