# Commitment 23

## Instill a greater sense of responsibility and protect public agents regarding the prevention of conflicts of interests

**Lead institutions**:
- Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service

### Stakes

The importance given to public officials’ exemplary behavior in their day-to-day actions for the general interest is an eminent element of the French republican model. The transposition of measures on the transparency in public life, to public agent, will further expand exemplarity within the civil service and obligations contained in the general statute of civil servants. A system will also be introduced to protect civil servants acting in good faith to report the existence of a conflict of interest.

### Context & Aim

More than thirty years after the enactment of the July 13th 1983 Bill, the **bill on ethics and the rights and obligations of officials**[^1] , when adopted, will update and complement the main fundamentals of the general statute of officials.

In particular, it aims to apply to civil servants and members of administrative and financial jurisdictions, mechanisms on the prevention of conflicts of interests detailed in the bill on transparency in public life. The **most exposed officials and administrative and financial magistrates** will thus be required to complete **declarations of interests before their appointments. Information on their assets will be passed on to the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life**.

An obligation to prevent and to resolve any conflict of interest will also be instituted. An offset mechanism has been put in place and a “management mandate” system will become mandatory for agents particularly concerned.
Finally, a protection mechanism has been introduced in the general statute of officials to allow an agent acting in good faith to report the existence of a conflict of interest without fear of reprisals.

The bill thus **consecrates the active role to be played by each official and non-permanent agent under public law in the prevention of conflicts of interest**: each agent is to act as the first guardian of ethical principles inherent to a civil servant position. This accountability of each public agent in the prevention of conflicts of interest complements an approach which, until now, has been under the sole responsibility of higher authorities of agents exposed to risk.

### Roadmap

- **Appoint an official, a service, or a legal entity under public law to provide agents under their authority with all relevant advice in respect of ethical obligations and principles**
